                    target="_blank">Norman Osborn</a> is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
                published by Marvel Comics. The character, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, first
                appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964) as the first and best-known incarnation of the Green
                Goblin.

                As the amoral industrialist head of Oscorp, Norman was exposed to an experimental formula which enhanced
                his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. Having endured as one of
                Spider-Man's archenemies, alongside Doctor Octopus and Venom, Osborn has been part of the superhero's
                defining stories as well as being the father of Harry Osborn, the grandfather of Normie Osborn and
                Gabriel and Sarah Stacy, and the killer of Gwen Stacy, Ben Reilly and Flash Thompson (the latter two
                later being resurrected). Although his primary obsession is Spider-Man, Osborn has often come into
                conflict with Iron Man, Captain America and other superheroes in the Marvel Universe. As the Goblin, he
                adopted a Halloween-themed appearance: dressing in a goblin costume, riding on a bat-shaped "Goblin
                Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, such as grenade-like "Pumpkin Bombs", to terrorize
                New York City. Although Osborn sometimes works with other supervillains such as Doctor Octopus, Doctor
                Doom and Loki and groups like the Sinister Six and the Dark Avengers, these relationships often collapse
                due to his desire for unbridled power. In recent years, Osborn gained new status as a public hero as the
                original iteration of Iron Patriot. Following the events of Secret Empire, the Carnage symbiote was
                stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by Osborn. With the combination of the symbiote and the
                Goblin serum, he went by as the Red Goblin.
